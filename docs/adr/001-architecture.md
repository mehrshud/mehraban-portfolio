# ADR: JavaScript Framework Selection for mehraban-portfolio
## Status: Approved
### Context
The mehraban-portfolio project requires a JavaScript framework for efficient and scalable development. The team has considered popular frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The primary goal is to select a framework that aligns with the project's requirements, ensuring maintainability, performance, and ease of development.
### Decision
After evaluating the available options, the team decides to use **React** as the JavaScript framework for the mehraban-portfolio project. React's component-based architecture, extensive community support, and ability to integrate with other libraries make it an ideal choice for this project.
### Consequences
The consequences of this decision are:
* **Improved Development Efficiency**: React's component-based approach will enable developers to work on individual components independently, reducing development time and increasing overall efficiency.
* **Enhanced Maintainability**: React's modular design will make it easier to update and maintain the codebase, reducing the risk of introducing bugs and improving the overall quality of the application.
* **Better Performance**: React's virtual DOM and optimized rendering process will ensure fast and seamless user interactions, providing a better user experience.
* **Easier Integration with Other Libraries**: React's flexibility and extensive ecosystem will allow for easy integration with other libraries and tools, reducing the complexity of the development process.
